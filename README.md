## Overview

As per client's request temperature data for the months of June and Decemeber in Oahu were filtered out of dataset. This data was then analyzed to determine if the client's buisness is sustainable year-round and what avenues they might partake in to mitigate any losses or take advantage of any gains during these months. 

## Results
Between the two months there are very slight differences that we can take into account:

**1. June:**
* The average temperature for June is **74.94** degrees F.
* The minimum temperature is **64** degrees F and maximum temperature is **85** degrees F.
* The standard deviation in temperature from the mean is **3.25** degrees F.

* The minimum temperature is **56** degrees F and maximum temperature is **83** degrees F.
* The standard deviation in temperature from the mean is **3.74** degrees F.

## Summary
Overall there is very minimal difference in temperature between the two months, so the W.Avy's business is sustainable all year round, if we were to base the findings off of the temperature. June and December despite being in different seasons, have similar average temperatures, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and even standard deviation of temperature, this indicates there is not a significant difference in temperature bewteen the months. However, the amount of precipation in the months could differ so we generated a query to filter out the precipitation for the two months to see the differences in rain. 


Between the two months it does rain slightly heavier in December on average of **0.2168** inches compared to June with an average of **0.1363** inches of rain. In addition to this the max inches of rain is **6.42** in December versus **4.43** inches in June. But it does seem to rain move often in June however, with the number of rain being **1574** while December had **1405** days of rain. There might be some drawbacks for W.Avy with the rain, so his company should try to take advantage of the summer months with the light rain by charging a bit more during these months in order to antcipate any closures he will need to do in the winter months when the rain is the heaviest. 

In conclusion, it seems that his business should be able to run sustainable during all months of the year, but he should keep in mind of certain weather and rain trends when pricing his goods in services to ensure that if closures are needed in later months he can still have enough profit margins from previous months.
